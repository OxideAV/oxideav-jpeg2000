# Changelog

All notable changes to `oxideav-jpeg2000` are recorded here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

* **Clean-room round 2 (2026-05-21).** SOT / SOD tile-part walker.
  New `Sot` / `TilePart` / `J2kCodestream` types and
  `walk_tile_parts(bytes, header)` / `parse_codestream(bytes)` entry
  points return an ordered list of tile-parts with the parsed
  `(Isot, Psot, TPsot, TNsot)` quartet plus byte offsets of the SOT
  marker, SOD marker, and bit-stream body inside the input slice.
  Both fixed-`Psot` and `Psot == 0` ("body until EOC") framings are
  supported per T.800 §A.4.2. Tile-part-header markers are
  validated against T.800 Table A.2's per-header allow-list — main-
  header-only markers (`SOC`, `SIZ`, `CAP`, `PRF`, `CRG`, `TLM`,
  `PLM`, `PPM`) trigger `Error::UnexpectedMainHeaderMarker`; legal
  in-tile-part markers (`COD`, `COC`, `RGN`, `QCD`, `QCC`, `POC`,
  `PLT`, `PPT`, `COM`) are skipped by length. Nine new unit tests
  covering single/multi-tile-part happy paths, Psot-zero streaming,
  overrun rejection, missing-EOC, illegal-marker-in-tile-part, COM
  injection, wrong-Lsot, and offset reporting against synthetic
  buffers. Sixteen tests total pass.

  Built solely against `docs/image/jpeg2000/T-REC-T.800-201906-S.pdf`
  (T.800 §A.2 / Table A.2 / §A.4.2 / Table A.5 / Table A.6 /
  §A.4.3 / Table A.7 / §A.4.4 / Table A.8). No external library
  source consulted.

* **Clean-room round 1 (2026-05-20).** Initial JPEG 2000 Part-1
  main-header parser: `SOC`, `SIZ`, `COD`, `QCD` marker segments are
  recognised, length-checked, and decoded into a typed `J2kHeader`
  struct (image extent, tile layout, per-component sample precision +
  sign + sub-sampling, progression order, decomposition levels,
  code-block geometry exponents, wavelet kernel, quantisation style,
  guard bits). Optional `CAP` / `PRF` / `COM` / `COC` / `QCC` / `RGN`
  / `POC` / `PLM` / `PPM` / `TLM` markers are skipped by length.
  Seven unit tests against synthesised byte buffers covering the
  happy path, multi-component case, optional-marker skip, missing
  `SOC` / `COD`, and invalid `Csiz`.

  Built solely against `docs/image/jpeg2000/T-REC-T.800-201906-S.pdf`
  (ITU-T T.800 / ISO/IEC 15444-1, §A.4 / §A.5 / §A.6 — Tables A.4,
  A.9–A.11, A.12–A.21, A.27–A.30). No external library source
  consulted.

  `decode_jpeg2000` and `encode_jpeg2000` still return
  `Error::NotImplemented`; body-decode (tier-1, tier-2, wavelet,
  dequant, MCT) is queued for future rounds.

### Changed

* **Orphan rebuild (2026-05-20).** The crate was reset to a clean-room
  scaffold. The prior implementation contained module-level docstrings
  and inline comments whose provenance could not be defended against
  the workspace clean-room rule (no external library source as
  reference, not even as a sanity check). Per the workspace's
  Implementer-Round procedure, such audit failures are unrecoverable
  via incremental cleanup and require an orphan rebuild.

  No `old` branch is retained; long-standing audit failures forfeit
  the archive per workspace policy.
